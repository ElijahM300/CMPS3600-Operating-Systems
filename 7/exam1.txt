1.The purpose of semaphore x is that it's the semaphore that the reader function uses 
in order to make sure that the first reader waits for wsem to finish before readers can start
reading and to make sure that the readcount variable is updated properly.

2. The purpose of semaphore wsem is used to enforce mutual exclusion which means in this
program, only one writer can have access to the shared data area, no other readers or
writers can access it until the writer is done.

3. The reader that would signal the writer to continue writing would be the last reader out
or rather when readcount = 0.

4. Only one writer can write at a time since wsem is enforcing mutual exclusion.

5. There can be as many readers as you want reading at one time, however, since the reader 
function uses wsem to also enforce mutual exclusion, there has to be at least one reader.

6. When semaphore x is initialized to a value of 1, it means that the semaphore is available for use
and the semWait() function will only work if the value of a semaphore is 1.
